## Challenge Overview
For this challenge, I created a dashboard detailing the diversity of bacteria samples taken from patients belly buttons. The dashboard charts and output box were created using d3 and Plotly.js, and were deployed in an HTML page. The Github Pages link above provides an opportunity to test and interact with my dashboard.
